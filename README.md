Penn WicS Resource Webpage
===
This is a web app that we built using Ruby on Rails which acts as a resource page for Penn Women in Computer Science. We wanted
to have a website available for women to access that had websites/files we thought were useful for things like interviews, a 
forum discussion, and other similar tools. Still in progress.
